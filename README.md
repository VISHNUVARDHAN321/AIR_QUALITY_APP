# AIR QUALITY APP

I am very excited to share my latest project which is air quality application. By giving inputs longitude and latitude , we know the the quality of air. My application gives AQI (Air Quality Index), CO (Carbon Monoxide), NO2 (Nitrogen Dioxide), O3 (Ozone), PM2.5 (Particulate Matter 2.5), PM10 (Particulate Matter 10) and SO2 (Sulfur Dioxide) values. By the knowing the above values we get quality of air.
I use html,css,javascript,json and api technologies inorder to get my project.
